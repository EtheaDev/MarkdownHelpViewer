# Markdown Help Viewer Demo

**A simple application to edit a table**

You can see an Index of the application functions [here...](Index.mdown)

This is only a simple demo, not all the operations are available, expecially the menu items.

This demo is used only to demonstrate the integration of a Delphi application with the "MarkDown Help Viewer" system.

Look at ["README file"](README.md) to see how it works.

In the Demo you can see also the use of the TMarkDownViewer component, to show the same help files [embedded into the application...](EmbeddedHelp.md)

Full source code of the "MarkDown Help Viewer" is available on Git-Hub [here...](https://github.com/EtheaDev/MarkdownHelpViewer)
