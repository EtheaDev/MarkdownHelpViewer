Markdown support test
=====================

![Markdown logo](markdownlogo.png)

This page is a small demonstration of Markdown support.  
  
From [CommonMark]:
>Markdown is a plain text format for writing structured documents,
>based on conventions for indicating formatting in email and Usenet posts.
>It was developed by John Gruber (with help from Aaron Swartz)
>and released in 2004 in the form of a syntax description and a
>Perl script (Markdown.pl) for converting Markdown to HTML.
>In the next decade, dozens of implementations were developed in many languages.

Formulas
--------
It is possible to use the [Google Chart API] using `TeX` language,
but the translated formula can only to be seen using a browser,
for insert a formula using `TeX` enclose the code between `$`
without `spaces`: 

Quadratic formula          |Zeta formula
---------------------------|-----------------------------
$x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ | $\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n^s}$
